# 🧠👁️ NeuroVision

**NeuroVision** is an AI-powered health intelligence platform designed to support **early disease detection**, **assistive vision support**, and **context-aware health insights**.  
The platform aims to reduce preventable health loss by enabling **early risk identification** and **better decision support**, without replacing medical professionals.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Delayed and fragmented diagnosis leads to preventable health complications.  
Early warning signs in medical scans and vision-related conditions are often subtle, time-consuming to analyze, and dependent on specialist availability.

There is a lack of a **unified, AI-assisted platform** that supports early detection, contextual health awareness, and accessibility-focused solutions.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
NeuroVision addresses this gap by providing:
- AI-assisted early risk detection
- Contextual health insights
- Assistive tools for visually impaired individuals
- Immersive awareness through VR-based simulations

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Early Detection
- AI-assisted analysis of medical imaging and health-related inputs  
- Risk-based outputs instead of binary diagnosis  
- Confidence scores and visual explanations  

### 👁️ Vision Health & Assistance
- Early vision risk identification  
- Object detection to assist navigation  
- Face expression detection to support social interaction  

### 🌍 Environmental Health Context
- Monitoring of air quality (AQI), pollutants, and allergens  
- Helps users understand environmental factors that may worsen health conditions  

### 🥽 VR-Based Disease Awareness
- Immersive simulations of eye diseases  
- Improves patient awareness, caregiver understanding, and medical empathy  

### ⚕️ Ethical & Responsible AI
- Doctor-in-the-loop approach  
- AI assists, but does not replace, medical professionals  
- Privacy-first and consent-based design

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User selects a service (health analysis, vision support, or awareness tools)  
2. Relevant data or images are provided  
3. AI models analyze inputs  
4. System generates:
   - Risk insights  
   - Confidence scores  
   - Visual explanations  
5. Results are used for **decision support**, not final diagnosis  

---

## 📊 Impact
- Supports early detection and preventive care  
- Helps reduce delayed diagnosis and avoidable health loss  
- Improves independence and quality of life for visually impaired users  
- Designed for scalability and real-world adoption  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Expansion to additional health domains and scans  
- Deeper environment–health correlation  
- Mobile-first assistive tools  
- Telemedicine and healthcare system integration
